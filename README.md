# HBD-RPG
Interactive Role-Playing Game (RPG)

Lore-heavy: The game focuses on the lore of Cotton Kingdom and does not contain much intense battle mechanics.

Male-centric: The game was originally developed for wishing the developer's brother on his birthday, so it is male-centric and does not have a gender-change feature.

Short and sweet: The game can be completed in 45-60 minutes and there is no post-game content.

Free to play: The game does not require any permissions or in-app purchases. It is completely free to play for life.

Made with RPG Maker MV: The game was created using the RPG Maker MV game engine. All credits and references are published at the end of the game as rolling credits.
